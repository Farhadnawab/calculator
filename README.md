# calculator - HTML / CSS / JS / VUE / AXIOS / AIRTABLE API

# Project Description from client:
We're building a WIX-webpage and need some extra functions to be implemented that WIX can not handle. This calculator should be built html - css - JS to be easily placed in the existing webpage.

The idea is pretty simple. The user comes to a website and finds the HTML block that you will create and follows a few steps:

1) (First Screen) - Enters an amount in KG (entry) & selects a type (dropdown)
2) (second page) - Selects a quantity per product (4 products) each product will deduct a preset value from the amount they entered in step 1
3) (Thirds screen) - Summary of previous entries & Fills in small form

The tool will be used by the client to find prospects for a new business idea. It will gather and save all the information in the tool to airtable (similar to google sheets or excel). They have a fantastic API to get all necessary information. Here is the documentation. (link removed)

I've already created the airtable with 2 tabs: tab on: "Data", this tab should be used to GET information and use in the tool. Tab "Form Output" is to be used to send all data from the form to. You can get access to the airtable through this link: (link removed) .

I will include the design files (in sketch & PDF below).
